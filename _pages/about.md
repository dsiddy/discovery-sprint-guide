# About this guide
The U.S. Digital Service (USDS) engages and partners with various agencies across the US federal government to work on technology improvement projects in service to the American people. Over the past six years, USDS has partnered with dozens of federal and state agencies to build more than 160 successful digital products. In our initial interactions with a government agency, we will often run what we call a Discovery Sprint. 

This guide intends to explain the sprint process and share some of our best practices to help teams adapt and run their own discovery sprints.

# What is the purpose of a discovery sprint?
Discovery Sprints are a useful method to quickly build a common understanding of the status of a complex organization, system or service. They can help create paths toward solutions by identifying specific, actionable next steps for the people at the organization who will carry that work forward. 

When we say “quickly” we mean that almost all of the work is completed in 2-4 weeks. A small cross-functional team of engineers, designers, product managers, and subject matter experts partner with an organization’s personnel to quickly explore an organizational problem or challenge. 

> The purpose of doing a discovery sprint is to help identify root causes, issues, and opportunities, but not to try to solve them in this time window.

During a discovery sprint the team will interview stakeholders at every level of the organization as well as end-users. They will also dig into available data, look at code in production, and observe processes. As a methodology, Discovery Sprints are not new -- they stem from best practices in Human-Centered Design. At USDS the organizations we typically engage with are federal agencies but, for this guide, we use the word “organization” as a placeholder for any group you would be doing your sprint work with. You can find definitions of other terms we use throughout this guide in the glossary.

### When is the right time to run a discovery sprint?
There’s never a bad time to run a discovery sprint, though we typically see them happen during these different phases on a project:

* Before a new tool, service or product is built
* When an existing tool, service or product is actively broken, or no longer meeting current or aspirational technology standards
* When key stakeholders change and a fresh perspective is useful to plan for or prioritize a new roadmap

### Discovery Sprint Scenario
Let’s take the example of a federal agency somewhere. Your discovery team has been brought in because the process of filing paperwork to help people receive a benefit they are entitled to is “slow”. One part of the Agency ecosystem is on the verge of spending 6 million dollars on more servers in an effort to solve this problem. On the face of it, this is a pretty cut and dried technology problem. But the agency leadership wants a gut check from a neutral observer.  The discovery team spends time talking with the office that is making the decision to spend the money but while they are there they also spend two weeks talking to the offices that are both up and downstream from the group that has brought them in. 

It turns out that the team that is filing the paperwork at the beginning phase of the process waits 1 week for a response, and then if they haven’t gotten an answer, they refile the paperwork again to “move the request to the top of the pile” because the consequences of a paperwork delay is that citizens may miss out altogether on receiving the benefits. Then the Discovery team goes and spends a couple of days in the office that is receiving the paperwork. This group overhauled their process 9 months ago and now they are batch processing requests on 3 days a week. This has improved their processing time by a lot and they are extremely proud of this. They don’t know why they seem to get so many duplicate requests now though. 
 
In the scenario above, each team is absolutely doing as much as they can to do the best job that they can for their stakeholders. In this case the report written at the end of the discovery sprint can highlight the work streams of both teams, identify some opportunities and make recommendations of what to do next. The report may also advise that spending money on servers at this stage is a solution that is unlikely to fix the challenges that the offices at the agency are facing.
