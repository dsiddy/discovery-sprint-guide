# Conducting the Discovery Sprint

Part of having a successful sprint is your team’s attitude from the start. Approach the work and the team’s relationships within the organization constructively and positively. You’ll be talking to many people and gathering as much information about the current state of the organization as possible. The meat of the sprint is two weeks of intensive work. It’s crucial to stick to the two-week time commitment to keep everyone focused and the sense of urgency high.
 
*On rare occasions, depending on team size and resource availability, it may be appropriate to extend the length of the sprint a few days (for intensive usability testing or specific travel, for instance), but it’s important to look back to the goals of the sprint and avoid scope creep—you are not here to do a full project or create solutions.

It is also important to figure out the sprint’s north star and check in on this often. Otherwise, sprints happen so quickly that it’s easy a team can lose sight of this. North stars are often a combination of organizational goals, team goals, and USDS values. Good “north star” targets are flexible enough to accommodate new information but fixed enough to serve as guidelines for if a particular interview or investigation path is worth the team’s time. Ultimately, your north star should tell you what you are trying to accomplish with the sprint.

The team is on the sprint to help an organization look at something with fresh eyes and start to have a conversation with them about where they could go. The team should be realistic about what they can accomplish in two weeks and make sure to loop in their sprint stakeholders to get their feedback as well. Lastly, as the sprint team uncovers more information, the team should constantly refocus and reprioritize to respond accordingly.

Here are some tips to keep in mind and revisit often during the research phase:
 
- Work from a learning mindset: you are there to learn from and enable your partners
- The organization has tremendous expertise and will have expended significant effort in this problem space already
- You are very likely not the first team that has shown up to them about these issues
- They are also setting time aside for you on top of their other responsibilities 
- Remember that the point of discovery is to look for the root causes and opportunities
 
It can be easy to fall back to a mode of just identifying all the problems and why they are harmful.  It’s easy for anyone to see the problems. There are often reams of paper, and a big backlog that detail these shortcomings. This is only part of the work. The goal of the sprint is not to add to that pile of paper. It's important to identify practical, pragmatic steps the organization can take to drive improvements and change. 
 
Remember that your recommendations do not all need to be technology fixes. It is possible that creating a new role, hiring people, or re-skilling or training some who are already there could be just as useful as building or buying more software or hardware. That said government systems advance by the decade, so it is also possible that something that was an expensive custom-built solution that hasn’t aged well, may now be replaceable with off the shelf solutions.
