**Conducting stakeholder interviews**

Ideally, the team should talk to as many people as they can possibly schedule during the two-week research phase of the sprint. This section covers logistics and the process for stakeholder interviews. 

**Note:** Sometimes your partner stakeholders may have concerns about how and with whom you plan to conduct research interviews, and they may say that doing this type of research is not allowed or even illegal in some cases. Depending on where you are, you may need to clear this misconception up before you are able to proceed further. Getting this worry uncovered and resolved as soon as possible will dramatically help you conduct the sprint more smoothly. If you have a ready answer for both you and your top-level stakeholders to reiterate during the kickoff meeting, it can save you a lot of delays if you get stuck later waiting for resolution. In US Federal government settings a common source for this concern is the Paperwork Reduction Act or PRA which can be confusing to interpret (there are some links about this in the resources section). Individual state governments may have their own policies, while academic and health-related institutions may have an Ethics/Institutional Review Board or IRB. The important thing is not to panic. Most of the people you are likely to be interviewing as part of your sprint will be internal or directly related to the organization you are working in service to, so you should be able to find a way to proceed that works within any concerns. That said, this is a case where having a lawyer, bureaucracy hacker or user research specialist on the team or able to consult can be very helpful.

**Laying the groundwork for successful interviews**

At the kick-off it is important for everyone in the room to hear the head of the organization, (or primary stakeholder) message that interviews will be happening, that they are a priority, and that the effort is supported by the organization. This will set the tone and help make the research phase go smoothly. If you have a member of the team who has a user research background then they should help drive this phase. If you don’t then this is an area where you could bring in an expert, even just for an hour or two of prep, to help the team feel ready to interview people.Before the interviews begin, sit down as a team and come up with a plan for them. List out what your goals are, what you want to learn, and come up with 5-10 core questions that you universally want to ask all of your participants. 

**DO:** Get a point of contact who is in the building and knows the people to help you with whatever you need while you are there (building access, a work space, the wifi password) go to lunch with them. Make friends.

**DO:** Pre-schedule as much as you can, but leave some open time blocks at the end of the day or the end of the week. 

- You will discover new people you are interested in talking to 
- You may need to reschedule people as things come up
- You may want to go back to an interviewee with more questions later on
- You can use any gaps in the schedule to collect notes and debrief as a team

**DO:** Plan to schedule most interviews for 45 - 60 minutes. 30 minutes is not long enough for an interviewee to warm up and get comfortable talking to you. 

**DO NOT:** Schedule back-to-back interviews. You want at least 15 minutes in between each session. And don’t forget to schedule lunch, you’ll focus better if you aren’t hungry.

- You will start late or run long a lot more often than you will ever finish early
- You may want to debrief or catch up with your notes between sessions 
- It may take a minute to find the next office location if you don’t know the building well
- Allow time for snacks and bio breaks

**DO:** Go where the person’s desk is to interview them (this may involve travel). They will be most comfortable where they are familiar, and seeing their surroundings can help you learn all sorts of things and structure your questions. Avoid sitting in a conference room with people coming to you as much as you can, this can feel a lot like being sent to the principal’s office for your interviewees and can get you off on the wrong foot before you even ask your first question. That said, in loud environments or large shared/open office spaces you may want a quieter space set aside to talk to people.**DO:** Whenever possible, stick to a ratio of one stakeholder to two sprint team members per interview. Multiple stakeholders can lead to groupthink, or the loudest or highest ranking stakeholder doing all the talking. No one should conduct an in-person stakeholder interview alone, and more than 2 people can be very intimidating (and don’t fit well in a cubicle). If the team is 5 people that makes it easy for two sets of interviewers to be working simultaneously, with the team Lead free to keep an eye on the schedule, the stakeholders and any other moving parts.

**Interview Process**

Arrive where you are going early, get settled, make some small talk about the office or the weather.
