title: Discovery Sprint Guide

# What is a discovery sprint?
Discovery Sprints are a useful method to quickly build a common understanding of the status of a complex organization, system or service, and they create momentum toward solutions by identifying specific, actionable next steps to the people on the ground who can carry that work forward.

A small cross-functional team of engineers, designers, product managers, and subject matter experts partner with an organization’s personnel to quickly explore a pressing organizational challenge. Depending on the engagement, the team will interview stakeholders at every level of the organization as well as end users. They will also dig into available data, look at code in production, or observe processes. As a methodology, Discovery Sprints are not new -- they stem from Human Centered Design best practices.

### When is the right time to run a discovery sprint?
There’s never a bad time to run a discovery effort, though we typically see them happen during these different phases on a project:

* Before a new tool, service or product is built
* When an existing tool, service or product is actively broken, or no longer meeting current or aspirational technology standards
* When key stakeholders change and a fresh perspective is useful to plan for or prioritize a new roadmap

## What this guide is
This guide intends to streamline the sprint process and carry forward our best practices to allow teams to focus on understanding the scenarios, or underlying issues in the list above, rather than the overhead of conducting a sprint. The document is organized by sprint activity:

* Preparing for the sprint
* Conducting the sprint
* Delivering the sprint findings
* Wrapping up the sprint
