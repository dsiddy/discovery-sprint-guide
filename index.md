title: Discovery Sprint Guide

# What is a discovery sprint?
Discovery Sprints are a useful method to quickly build a common understanding of the status of a complex organization, system or service, and they create momentum toward solutions by identifying specific, actionable next steps to the people on the ground who can carry that work forward.

A small cross-functional team of engineers, designers, product managers, and subject matter experts partner with an organization’s personnel to quickly explore a pressing organizational challenge. Depending on the engagement, the team will interview stakeholders at every level of the organization as well as end users. They will also dig into available data, look at code in production, or observe processes. As a methodology, Discovery Sprints are not new -- they stem from Human Centered Design best practices.

### When is the right time to run a discovery sprint?
There’s never a bad time to run a discovery effort, though we typically see them happen during these different phases on a project:

* Before a new tool, service or product is built
* When an existing tool, service or product is actively broken, or no longer meeting current or aspirational technology standards
* When key stakeholders change and a fresh perspective is useful to plan for or prioritize a new roadmap

#### Staffing
The particulars of your body copy will be determined by the topic of your page. Regardless of topic, it’s a good practice to follow the inverted pyramid structure when writing copy: Begin with the information that’s most important to your users and then present information of less importance.

Keep each section and subsection focused — a good approach is to include one theme (topic) per section.

#### Subsection heading
Use the side navigation menu to help your users quickly skip to different sections of your page. The menu is best suited to displaying a hierarchy with one to three levels and, as we mentioned, to display the sub-navigation of a given page.

Read the full documentation on our side navigation on the component page.
